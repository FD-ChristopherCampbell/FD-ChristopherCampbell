### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christy, welcome to my Github profile. I'm a Software Engineering Manager working at FanDuel working on our internal developer portal Kickoff. I joined in 2019 and was mostly been working on our A&W integrations with Casino and Sportsbook platforms until recently.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything which improves the developer experience of our projects and repos.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Observability as Code, Github Actions, Slack bots, software templating

ðŸ“« How to reach me: @Christopher.Campbell on the FD Slack

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

âš¡ Fun fact: Part of the reason I wanted to join FanDuel was that I'm a big US sports fan (Denver Broncos, Boston Bruins, Boston Celtics fan) and I also play linebacker/centre/long-snapper for the Dunfermline Kings American Football team
