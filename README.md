### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christy, welcome to my wee Github profile. I'm a Software Engineering Manager working at FanDuel. I joined in 2019 and have mostly been working on our A&W integrations with Casino and Sportsbook platforms.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything which automates or optimises our processes around regualated releases, Observability as Code and anything which improves the developer experience of our projects and repos.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Observability as Code, Github Actions, Slack bots

ðŸ“« How to reach me: @Christopher.Campbell on the FD Slack

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

âš¡ Fun fact: Part of the reason I wanted to join FanDuel was that I'm a big US sports fan (Denver Broncos, Boston Bruins, Boston Celtics fan) and I also play linebacker for the Dunfermline Kings American Football team
